# Modern-Xonix-Game
The "Modern Xonix" Game is a contemporary adaptation of the classic arcade game "Xonix".  
 We used SFML and C++ for this project.In this updated version, the game retains the 
 fundamental gameplay mechanics of cutting off sections of a playing field while avoiding
 enemies, but introduces modern graphics,  enhanced new gameplay elements such as power-ups. 
 The project aims to appeal to both nostalgic fans of the original game and a new generation
 of players with its refreshed look and additional features. The development of "Modern Xonix"
 likely involves game designers, programmers, and artists working together to create a game 
 that balances thecharm of the original with innovative updates for a modern gaming audience.
